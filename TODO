- Replace the owned_count sharing with MPI_All_Gather
- Change ownership of hanging nodes to be the not full side


# DONE
- Construct sharers
- Send the owned nodes shared with other processes nodes, (in order of local nodes)
   and the owned_count.
- Receive the nodes, and compute the nonlocal_nodes (global indices)
      and global_offset.
- FIX: Additional faces are sometimes added twice
- FIX: Determine face split in 3D, by global node id
